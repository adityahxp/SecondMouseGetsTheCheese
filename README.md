# SecondMouseGetsTheCheese
Reinforcement Learning Experiment in Unity.
2019: A 3D reenactment and visualization of reinforcement learning.

I built a program and environment in Unity to teach a mouse with no prior knowledge that cheese is good and trap is bad. 
The mouse's goal is to find cheese and avoid traps.
I implemented this with Unity's ML Agents framework, using TensorFlow to define the model.
Here's a [link to the visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3OBuZosL5E).
